# 1-Wire-CRC-
1-Wire 8 Bit CRC Generation Using Matlab

The error detection scheme most effective at locating errors in a serial-data stream with a minimal amount of hardware is the CRC. The CRC can be most easily understood by considering the function as it would actually be built in hardware, usually represented as a shift register arrangement with feedback as shown in Figure 2.
